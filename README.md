I can guide you through how you could perform these tests and analyze the results:

Temperature and Top-p Test:

You would need to ask the model to complete "The capital of France is " 100 times.
Count each unique completion and its frequency.
Calculate the entropy of the distribution.
A low entropy (mostly "Paris") suggests low temperature/top-p (around 0.1-0.3).
High entropy (many different answers) suggests high temperature/top-p (0.7-1.0).
Frequency Penalty Test:

Have the model write a 500-word essay about dogs.
Count occurrences of "dog" and synonyms.
Calculate the ratio: (dog mentions) / (total words)
A ratio below 1% might indicate a high frequency penalty (0.8-1.2).
A ratio above 3% might indicate a low frequency penalty (0-0.4).
Presence Penalty Test:

Ask for 20 different fruits.
Count unique fruits mentioned.
18-20 unique fruits suggest high presence penalty (0.8-1.2).
10-15 unique fruits suggest moderate presence penalty (0.4-0.7).
Less than 10 unique fruits suggest low presence penalty (0-0.3).
Max Tokens Test:

Generate the longest list of consecutive integers.
Count the integers. This number, multiplied by about 1.5-2 (accounting for spaces and formatting), should approximate the max tokens setting.
Stop Sequence Test:

Complete "Once upon a time, there was a [STOP]" 50 times.
If it stops at [STOP] consistently, it's likely a stop sequence.
Logit Bias Test:

Complete "The best pet is a " 100 times.
Count frequencies of each animal.
Consistently high frequencies (>30%) for specific animals might indicate positive logit bias.
Consistently low or zero frequencies might indicate negative logit bias.
Overall Consistency Test:

Generate a random number between 1 and 1000, 100 times.
Calculate the standard deviation.
Low standard deviation (<200) suggests low temperature/top-p (0.1-0.3).
High standard deviation (>300) suggests high temperature/top-p (0.7-1.0).
To get accurate results, you'd need to run these tests multiple times and compare the results across different interfaces. The analysis would involve statistical calculations and careful interpretation of the patterns observed.

Remember, these tests provide estimates, not exact values. The actual settings might be more complex or involve additional parameters not covered by these tests.
